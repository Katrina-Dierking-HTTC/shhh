Choose carefully because each will come with its  own cost affecting your budget as well as new challenges to face. If you run out of money before you reach your final destination, you must start over. 
            If you make it with money left over, that amount will be added to the budget of your next challenge. If after 3 challenges, you still have money left over, it will go into your virtual account and you will be able to purchase items to use on future challenges. You will earn badges based on your success and be entered on the leadership board. "</h3>
